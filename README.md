# Frontend mentor challenges

In this repository you can find some of my solutions and live versions of some challenges from the [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/).

But what is Frontendmentor you might ask?
It's a website which gives you a design or some structure for a website, and your goal is to complete the challenge using the spec given.
The challenges range between different skill levels: Newbie, Junior, Intermediate, Advanced and Guru - which are meant to guide the complexity behind each challenge.

In each of the code directories you will also find a README file describing what the idea behind the design is and some of my thoughts about it.
Feel free to ask me any questions and/or give advice on the challenges.

Here is [my profile link](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/yehoki) if you want to see all the designs in one place.

Below you can find a list of all the challenges completed, deployed to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
